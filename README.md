# ReverseJoy
Mouse and Keyboard to virtual controller input translator. This can give aim assist and axis heavy movement in certain games. <br>
This also can give keyboard and mouse support for games that only support controllers, such as emulated games. <br>
I recommend you fork and edit the code if you want something more customizable than this, as this is more just for my hardcoded personal use.

# How to use
Install vJoy driver, ViGem bus driver, and Interception driver: <br>
https://sourceforge.net/projects/vjoystick/ <br>
https://vigembusdriver.com/ <br>
https://github.com/oblitum/Interception <br>
Then download the ReverseJoy program in releases and make sure you have C++ redistrutable installed. <br>

# Controls
G to toggle active (off goes into normal mouse and keyboard input) <br>
J to kill switch the entire program <br>
H to toggle mouse override (so right stick and left/right triggers are bound to mouse)
WASD to move left stick around for movement <br>
Space to press A button <br>
Q to press X button <br>
E to press B button <br>

3 to press right bumper  <br>
Mouse movement to control right stick to aim and look around <br>

Extra binds to do later: <br>
